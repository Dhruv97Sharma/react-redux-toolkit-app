# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Using The PokeAPI for Pokemon Data

This template uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for Pokemon data. The PokeAPI is a free REST API that provides data about Pokemon. 

The PokeAPI is a great resource for learning how to use REST APIs in React. 

## Development


To run the app, git clone the repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruv97Sharma/react-redux-toolkit-app.git
```

```bash
npm install
```

run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

To create a production version of your app, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. Then, run the `serve` script:

```bash
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```

This starts a development server, which reloads the page when you save changes to your file.
